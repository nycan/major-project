# Project Description
A quadrupedal robot, like Boston Dynamics' robot dog, or MIT's cheetah.

## Needs to Have List

- Arduino/Raspberry Pi controller
- 3d-printed/DIY parts
- Electronic connections & actuators + power supply
- Sensors (servo or other)
- Algorithms for walking

## Nice to Have List

- Stablization algorithms
- Other forms of locomotion (eg. rolling/hopping) & transitions between
- Error correction
- Remote/autonomous control
