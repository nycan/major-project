# Quadrupedal robot
This is a simulation of a quadrupedal robot.

Instructions:
- run `source scripts/relaunch` to start the simulation. It may take a while to start.
- use the command in `scripts/example_cmd` to change the velocity. It should range from -1 to 1 with negative velocities being walking backwards.
